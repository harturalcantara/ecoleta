# ‚ôªÔ∏è Ecoleta 

Ecoleta is a model of connecting companies and entities that collect organic and inorganic waste to people who need to dispose of their waste in an ecological way.

Companies or entities may register on the web platform by sending:

- An image of the collection point, name of the entity, email and whatsapp and the address so that it can appear on the map.
- In addition to selecting one or more collection items:
- Lamps
- Batteries
- Papers and cardboard
- Electronic waste
- Organic waste
- Kitchen oil

Users will have access to the mobile application, where they can:
- Browse the map to see the registered institutions.
- Contact the entity through E-mail or WhatsApp.
